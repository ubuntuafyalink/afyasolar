/**
 * PAYG & Financing queries.

 * The accounting platform v2 owns the schema (`accounting_financing_contracts`
 * and `accounting_repayment_entries`); this module reads/writes those tables
 * via raw SQL so we don't need to mirror them into Drizzle here.
 *
 * Every facility-side helper enforces ownership by joining/filtering on
 * `customer_id = facilities.id` (a contract's `customer_id` is the facility id).
